  Codebase for Cube<sup>3</sup>'s newest project, a CanSat! CanSats are soda-can-sized satellites, using several sensors such as barometers, GPS, radios, and cameras to capture and communicate data. Our CanSat aims to be dropped from ~2300ft high, carrying out several duties during it's descent, such as deploying a heatshield, releasing a parachute, capturing the fall on video, and landing itself upright (all within a satellite the size of a Coke can!)
